# ManiGuard fruits implementation and study record

Started 17 October 2026. The user authorized implementation and empirical testing of all
six hypotheses in `fruits.md`, incremental pushes to Safety-Dial, and Hugging Face storage
for checkpoints when needed. The complete objective remains active until all six have
executable implementations, appropriate engineering checks and physical evaluation evidence.
Negative results are valid; unit tests alone do not test a manipulation hypothesis.

## Required evidence

| Hypothesis | Implementation | Initial physical comparison | Further comparison |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Adaptive replanning | Chunk scheduler with observable triggers | Original vs fixed execution horizons | Fixed/adaptive rules, random, evolution and ordinary learning; query-cost controls |
| 2. Motion moderation | Absolute joint-target limiter and smoothing | Original vs fixed motion settings | Same adapter family across optimizers |
| 3. Prerequisite transitions | Closure-before-lift guard and continuation controller | Original vs fixed guard; preserved task success | Matched-information controllers and optimizer comparison |
| 4. Grasp persistence | Bounded release debounce using finger/command history | Original vs fixed release delay | Contextual adapter and optimizer comparison |
| 5. Retry failed approaches | Observable stall detector and bounded physical retry | Original continuation vs fixed retry | Retry selection under the same episode horizon |
| 6. Post-intervention hand-back | Controller around an unchanged prerequisite guard | Immediate return vs settle/requery | Return-control adaptation with intervention history |

For each row preserve code/config hashes, setup checks, executed episodes, action traces,
safe/unsafe completion and non-completion counts, uncertainty and interaction/query/time
costs. Establish whether the proposed failure mechanism actually occurs and whether the
correction helps. Do not substitute artificial state fixtures for the empirical study.
A failed mechanism screen must be reported as such, with its scope and observations.

## Execution sequence

1. Pin upstream sources and model/benchmark assets; install separate simulator and policy
   environments with uv. Preserve the old UNISafe environment specification.
2. Validate rendering, the long-finger robot, policy interface, original task outcomes and
   active safety monitoring. Confirm unchanged-controller action equivalence.
3. Freeze scene-group splits before examining development trajectories. Reserve related
   variants together. Released VLA training overlap remains distinct from our split.
4. Run baseline development episodes and measure throughput before fixing realistic search
   budgets. Implement all six adapters, testing meaningful action/history invariants.
5. Run the fixed-control screens, targeted diagnostics and matched optimization studies.
   Use full episodes; do not assume exact simulator restoration. Compare ordinary learning
   over the same interface and disclose what it does and does not learn.
6. Freeze selections before reserved evaluation. Analyze all methods and all hypotheses,
   preserve results off-instance, and push the final report and reproduction instructions.

No pretrained policy weights need change for the initial studies. Physical specification
thresholds remain fixed. For closure and lift diagnostics, explicitly privileged simulator
signals are permitted as a labelled prototype, shared by all compared controllers; those
results do not establish a visual-only or deployable learned safety filter. Any sensor-based
version requires its own evaluation. Retries cannot erase previous violations.

All candidates, failed jobs, warmups and diagnostic interactions count in the run ledger.
Searches are offline simulator adaptation, not online learning on the final test scenes.
Report inference queries separately because replanning changes their cost. Preserve original
proposals, adapter outputs and final executed actions. Use new output directories.

## Initial state

- Repository started at `2fe652fbbb524a41b4afc9c1bdb4dc6be23594de` on `main`.
- ManiGuard source fetched at `6bf4c61a1f168cc46e02eb22c41bcb51815e9726`.
- Current machine: RTX 3090 24 GB, NVIDIA 580.95.05, Python 3.10.21 base,
  CUDA toolkit 12.4. No simulator or policy packages initially installed.
- `/workspace` is not a persistent host volume. Git pushes and private artifact storage
  are therefore part of the work, not optional end-of-study cleanup.
- Current upstream defaults include high-fidelity rendering. The study must explicitly
  select and record its visual/controller configuration; exact historical reproduction
  is not established by installing the latest source.
- Current status: environment and asset preparation. No ManiGuard episodes executed.

## Initial implementation milestone

All six adapters now have pure controller implementations and initial JSON configurations.
Twenty-one behavior tests pass, including identity action preservation, finite release
and retry limits, prerequisite scope, hand-back timing and same-seed episode isolation.
Ruff passes on the new Python files. These are engineering checks, not physical results.

The separate simulator and OpenPI environments installed successfully. CUDA tensor execution,
native Spot formula construction, Isaac Sim import and OmniGibson import passed on this
machine. Benchmark assets finished downloading and have local SHA-256 provenance. The large
simulator asset archive and policy checkpoints are still being prepared.

Scene groups were assigned deterministically before inspecting baseline trajectories:
Jar has 4 engineering, 6 training, 4 validation and 12 test tasks; Lid has 4/10/4/12;
Stack has 4/8/4/12. Every condition of a task retains the same assignment. Seeds and
physical search budgets remain to be selected after baseline throughput measurement.

A local policy wrapper resets sampling on each distinct episode, including consecutive
same-seed episodes. The upstream wrapper only resets when the seed changes, which would
otherwise confound consecutive matched-method comparisons. The evaluator instrumentation
preserves upstream goal and monitor checks and logs original/adapted/executed actions.
Physical accounting includes initialization steps through a PhysX subscription.
